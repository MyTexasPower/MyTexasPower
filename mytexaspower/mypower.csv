This pay-as-you-go plan lets you begin electricity service without a security deposit. Simply make an initial account payment, and your electricity usage will be subtracted from your balance. Set up daily usage notifications and low balance alerts to help you manage your costs. This plan requires customers to have a provisioned Smart Meter and you must maintain a positive balance to avoid interruption of service. Except for price changes allowed by law or regulatory action after the issue date, this price is the price that will be applied on your first billing day. This price may change on the first of each calendar month at Reliant's sole discretion. Please review the historical price of this product available at reliant.com/smartstart/pricing/historical or call 1-866- 222-7100.**To receive a matching credit, your initial payment must be on the same day as enrollment and be at least $30. The maximum matching credit is $ 150. Only the initial payment will be matched, subsequent payments are not eligible for the matching credit.","http://www.reliant.com/files/090175188091fa21.pdf","False","","https://www.reliant.com/files/09017518812f4477.pdf","http://www.reliant.com/en/public/reliant-smartstart-plan.jsp?txtPromocode=WM0529&sid=APR_2011SmartStartPTC","https://www.reliant.com/en/Images/R1F1738aSmartStart_Disclosure_Statement-2.pdf","(855) 350-8650","TRUE","TRUE"
